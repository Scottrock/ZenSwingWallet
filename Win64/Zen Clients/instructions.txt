To start zend just run "start zend.bat"

To open a command prompt in the current folder type "cmd" in the explorer address field,
then type ".\zen-cli.exe help" to see a list of available commands.

To stop zend run ".\zen-cli.exe stop", ctrl+c does not cleanly shut down zend. You will have to kill it in Task Manager.
